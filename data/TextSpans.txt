1837539	Outcome	 primary
endpoint was treatment responsiveness 
1837539	Outcome	Participants assigned to CYC experienced more serious
adverse events (SAEs) considered to be drug-related by a morbidity
and mortality committee compared with patients assigned to MMF (22%
versus 7%, respectively), although the majority of SAEs were deemed
to be related to underlying ILD (Table 1). 
1837539	Outcome	During the study period,
there were 11 deaths (15%) in the CYC group and 5 deaths (7%) in the
MMF group
1837539	Outcome	The present findings demonstrate that
treatment with MMF is associated with fewer SAEs deemed to be
drug-related and fewer deaths compared with treatment with CYC in
patients with SSc-ILD. Moreover, MMF appears to be better tolerated
than CYC. (Table Presented).

1074663	Outcome	The degree of patient comfort and satisfaction with an inhaler can have an important effect on compliance with asthma treatment and, hence, therapeutic success. The objective of this study was to assess, from the patient's perspective, the importance of various inhaler characteristics and then evaluate patient satisfaction with a new breath-actuated powder inhaler (Diskhaler) based on those characteristics.
1074663	Outcome	At baseline, patients rated the importance of five inhaler characteristics (convenient to carry, durability, easy to load, easy to hold and operate, and easy to clean). Following exposure to the Diskhaler over a period of 8 weeks, patients rated the inhaler on those same characteristics. They also rated their comfort using the inhaler and their overall satisfaction with the inhaler.

1271458	Condition	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
1271458	InterventionType	Transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation (TCEMS) 
1271458	Outcome	There was no significant change in lung function, peak workload, or peak oxygen consumption in either group
1271458	Outcome	The improvement in muscle strength carried over to better performance in the shuttle walk test in the treated group (36.1% v 1.6% in the treated and sham groups respectively, p=0.007, Mann-Whitney U test).
1271458	Outcome	Quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength, exercise capacity, and peak oxygen uptake were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks of stimulation. RESULTS: TCEMS improved both the quadriceps strength (by 39.0 (20.4)% v 9.0 (8.1)%, p=0.046) and hamstring muscle strength (by 33.9 (13.0)% v 2.9 (4.7)%, p=0.038) in the treated (n=9) and sham treated (n=9) groups, respectively.

1206267	InterventionType	usual care (control group C
1206267	Outcome	one year after the educational intervention, it was observed that the program had added value over and above that of optimization of medication and regular clinical follow-ups. The education program was highly effective in promoting HDM avoidance measures but minimally effective for removing domestic animals, suggesting that more efficient strategies need to be developed for the latter.
1206267	Outcome	 several studies have examined the influence of asthma education, focusing mainly on the use of health services
1206369	Condition	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
1206369	InterventionType	Eighty one patients were randomised to receive conventional inpatient care (n=40) or to planned early discharge the next working day (n=41).

1009902	Condition	Forty literate adult asthmatics
1009902	InterventionType	In Western Europe medicine packages contain an insert prepared by the manufacturer which enumerates the drug side-effects. We investigated the influence of this insert on alleged theophylline side-effects.
1009902	Outcome	During this period the patients filled a diary grading 13 different symptoms from 0 to 3; 5 of these symptoms were listed on the insert as theophylline side-effects. On the eighth day the patients were interviewed and theophylline blood levels measured.
1009901	Condition	Thirty two asthmatics
1009901	InterventionType	Budesonide 400 micrograms daily
1009901	InterventionType	In a double-blind, randomized manner, half were assigned to remain on a maintenance dose (MD) and the rest received twice that dose (MDx2) for one year.

1011802	Condition	One hundred thirty-three adult patients with either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the emergency department with asthma or wheezing.
1011802	InterventionType	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a loading dose of aminophylline followed by a routine infusion (n = 65) or an equal volume of placebo as a loading dose and infusion (n = 68). 
1011802	Outcome	At discharge from the emergency department, the median serum theophylline concentration for the aminophylline group was 54 mumol/L (9.7 mg/L). The two groups showed no differences (P greater than 0.2) in measurements of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at baseline or at 60 or 120 minutes after aminophylline administration. Neither patient satisfaction nor physician assessment of response to therapy differed between the two groups. There was no difference (P greater than 0.2) in the frequency of side effects, except for a trend toward a higher frequency of nausea (P = 0.13) in the aminophylline group. There was, however, a threefold decrease in the hospital admission rate for patients treated with aminophylline (6%) compared with placebo recipients (21%) (P = 0.016).
